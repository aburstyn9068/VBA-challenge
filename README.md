# VBA-challenge
VBA Stocks Project

This repository contains the code to analyze stock market data. It will take multiple lines of data for stocks on a spreadsheet and combine them into a single line summarizing the entire year. It will display the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each ticker in the sheet.

Additionally, the code display the ticker and value for the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease, and greatest total value on the spreadsheet.

The code will run for all sheets in the workbook.

I included a .bas and .vbs file of the code because the Excel on my computer will only allow me to use the .bas file. I changed the extension on the .bas file to .vbs to create that version.
